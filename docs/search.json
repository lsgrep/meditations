    "text": "Do you believe in free will? You may or may not believe in free will, but you can’t deny the importance of context. Your context is the environment in which you live in and the content you consumed in the past. Your next move is probably already decided or heavily influenced by your context.\nGarbage in garbage out\nThis I read this phrase from Steal Like an Artist (affiliated) which is the first English book I read, it stuck in my head till this day. \nI have been listening to podcasts for a few years now. Apart from books, podcasts became the main source of information for me.\n\nHuberman Podcast\nThis is probably the best podcast on health and wellness. Professor Andrew Huberman covers a lot of relevant and useful topics. Our body is the only machine that does not come with a user manual. The content Hubermanlab provides can be used as that missing manual. \n\n\nThe Joe Rogan Experience\nHe had some controversial stuff in the past as like the most public figures, so take everything he says with a grain of salt. After hearing lots of MMA and fighting related content, I decided to try out Muay Thai, and it has been the best thing I tried for a long long while. I think Muay Thai had tremendous affect on my physical and mental health.\nCombat sports not only can straighten your belly but also your ego and confidence.\nAnother great thing about his podcast is that he introduces a lot of people from different backgrounds, I got to know David Goggins, Wim Hof, Graham Hancock, Guy Ritchie and many more.\nIt has been more than two years since I started taking cold showers. It kinda gives me the shock and energy to go on when I am low.\nDavid Goggins has a great book. Can’t Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds (affiliated) .  The book is about a lazy ass man’s redemption through physical training. It is also a journey of learning how to control your mind. It is really fascinating.\n\n\nLex Fridman Podcast\nHe has really awesome guests. Most of his content is intellectually heavy."

    "text": "I have always had a fond inclination towards meditation. I have been practicing meditation on and off for a couple years. I even came up with my own methods of meditation, maybe that is for another post.\nIf I remember correctly I think Andrew Huberman once said that meditation is a special state in which you can upgrade your source code of your brain/consciousness.\nThere are many things we don’t know enough about, and mind/brain is one of them.\nI tried Bhagavad Gita a couple of times but got intimidated by the names and characters as they are all Hindi. It is hard to memorize long names as you have no idea how the Hindi names are constructed. Somehow I pulled through, and finished the book gladly.\nThere are a lot can be learned from the Gita. What struck me the most is the immortality of self .\nDiscourse 2, Bhagavad Gita\n\nThe self is not born nor does it ever die. Once it has been, this self will never cease to be again. Unborn, eternal, continuing from the old, the self is not killed when the body is killed\n\nDiscourse 2, Bhagavad Gita\n\nAnd as you discern your own dharma, you should not waver. For the warrio, htere can be found nothing greater than battle for the sake of dharma.\n\nThe idea is that you are immortal, thus have no fear, face your enemies, pursue your dharma.\n\nYour authority is in action alone, and never in its fruits; motive should never be in the fruits of action, nor should you cling to inaction\n\nFocus on action, not the results, live a meditative life.\nBhagavad Gita means the song of the God. It is as poetic and as beautiful as it can be. It is a book that you can read over and over again, and you will always find something new.\nAfter finishing the Gita, I started reading Meditations by Marcus Aurelius.\nMeditations is a stark contrast to Bhagavad Gita, as Marcus Aurelius is brought upon the knowledge of Greek golden age, in which logic and reason are the main pillars of the society. It also has totally different take on death, that we all die, and we might die at any given moment.\nBook 2\n\nYou may leave this life at any moment: have this possibility in your mind in all that you do or say or think.\n\nBook 3\n\nSo we must have sense of urgency, not only for the ever closer approach of death, but also because our comprehension of the world and our ability to pay proper attention will fade before we do.\n\nDeath is maybe imminent and we should take every action as the last one we can take. This brings the same liberation that Bhagavad Gita brings, although they are achieved by different angles.\nBook 4\n\nNo action should be undertaken without aim, or other than in conformity with principle affirming the art of life.\n\nBook 7\n\nRemember these two things: the action is important, the context indifferent.\n\nOne from the east and one from the west, one is spiritual, and the other is logical, and core ideas somehow converge one way or another. Both are astoundingly beautiful and full of wisdom."

    "text": "I have an Ubuntu desktop machine with an old Nvidia card. It has OKish specs, but it is a bit noisy for my liking. In short, I’ve made it into a publicly accessible Jellyfin media server with Traefik+Wireguard and moved it to the corner of my place with USB WiFi stick plugged in.\n\nWiFi\n\nYou have install kernel drivers for the WiFi stick first, and the drivers are vendor specific.\ncheck available devices\n\niwconfig\nwlp4s0 is the device name for my USB WiFi stick.\n\nbring the device up\n\nsudo ifconfig wlp4s0 up\n\ncheck available wireless networks\n\nsudo iwlist wlp4s0 scan | grep ESSID\n\nconnect to the network\n\n# generate & save password\nwpa_passphrase your-ESSID your-wifi-passphrase | sudo tee /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf\n# -B is for running things in background\nsudo wpa_supplicant -B -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -i wlp4s0\n\n# get an IP address\nsudo dhclient wlp4s0\n\nAutoconnect to WiFi after reboot\n\n# crontab for the root\nsudo crontabe -u root -e\n\n# content of crontab\n# @reboot sleep 5 && /usr/local/bin/wifi.sh 2&gt;&1 &gt;&gt; /var/log/reboot.log\n#!/bin/bash\n# wifi.sh\n/usr/sbin/rfkill unblock wifi || true\n/sbin/ifconfig wlp4s0 up || true\n/sbin/wpa_supplicant -B -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -i wlp4s0 || true\n/sbin/dhclient wlp4s0 || true\n\nDisable WiFi power saving\n\nDisable wifi power management directly by editing /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/default-wifi-powersave-on.conf and changed the value from 3 to 2, saved changes and reboot.\n\nPerformance Tweaks\n\n# To ameliorate the connection through the intel wifi card you can:\n\n# Disable 802.11n\n# Enable software encryption\n# Enable the transmission antenna aggregation\n# Disable bluetooth coexistence\n# Create a /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf with the following content :\noptions iwlwifi 11n_disable=1\noptions iwlwifi swcrypto=1\noptions iwlwifi 11n_disable=8\noptions iwlwifi bt_coex_active=0\n\n\nRemote Desktop\nI’ve tried lots of things for remote desktop, then settled for Chrome Remote Desktop. Official docs are not so reliable, and this gist did the trick.\nHonestly I don’t use this at all, but I think it is nice to have.\n{% gist ae09f72bd5badc64d4727a0d38fc590b %} https://gist.github.com/organizm/ae09f72bd5badc64d4727a0d38fc590b\n\n\nMedia Server\n\nJellyfin is free & open source, and it is not bloated with ads. Start Jellyfin with Nvidia hardware acceleration enabled(You can check out docs for more). Docker-compose is buggy with GPUs, so I have to use command line for this. You have to install nvidia-docker2 before hand.\n\ndocker run -d \\\n --name=jellyfin \\\n -e NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all \\\n -e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all \\\n --gpus all \\\n --pid host \\\n --runtime=nvidia \\\n -p 8096:8096 \\\n -p 8920:8920 \\\n -v /data/jellyfin/config:/config \\\n -v /data/jellyfin/media:/media \\\n -v /data/jellyfin/cache:/cache \\\n --restart unless-stopped \\\n jellyfin/jellyfin:unstable\nSince it is sharing(--pid host) PID namespace with host, you can run nvidia-smi on host machine directly to see if Jellyfin is using GPU when transcoding content.\n\n\n\njellyfin-nvidia\n\n\n\nRegister an OpenSubtitles.org account and install the plugin for the Jellyfin. You have to login with your account in the plugin settings page. With this you can add subtitles to your videos without too much effort.\n\n\n\nSyncing Remote Folders\nrclone is kinda aggressive, so you have to use --max-delete 0 to keep your files intact in your destination.\nrclone sync --max-delete 0 -v REMOTE_DRIVE:legal_movies movies --stats 10s\n\n\nInternet Access\nThe desktop is connected to a VPS instance with WireGuard.

    "text": "“Making a full sentence is pretty difficult for the brain.” - Something I learned from one of the great Andrew Huberman podcasts.\n\nI am no trained psychiatrist, but I have an intuition that writing probably makes thinking process easier by taking certain amount of load off from the prefrontal cortex.\n\nWriting & Being Perfect\nI was never good at writing or taking notes. It always took me an awful lot of time get started with any form of writing. Probably I was or still am a perfectionist, and I always wanted to get things right the first time. &gt; Perfectionism stems from the fear of our mortality. - Susan &gt; Cain, Lex Fridman Podcast\nOur brain works by punishing the loss and rewarding the gains. Making mistakes could be detrimental to our survival in the early stages of human existence, and we always receive negative feedbacks from supervisors or peers for our mistakes. Thus we avoid errors, mistakes, or failures at any cost.\nFear of failure could be the major hindrance to our productivity, but in reality failure, or errors are the norm. Getting things right is just rare. If I learned anything in my life, it would be thinking in terms of errors. Our brain hardly predicts anything correctly, nor our actions match the expectations. So let’s modify the optimization target. “We are bound to miss, but we can try to minimize the negative margins.(or increase the positive margins)”\n\n\nHow to Take Smart Notes\nI think learned a few things after reading the book. How to Take Smart Notes (affiliated). \nIt officially introduced me to the concept of Zettlekasten (slipbox, backlinks).\nMain philosophy:\n\nRather taking a top to down approach to writing (think everything through at the start), start from taking random notes, then when think you are ready you can connect the dots and complete the writing (bottom to top).\n\nActionable Steps:\n\ndo your research\ntake notes into slipbox whenever you find something interesting\nreorganize your notes from slipbox with backlinks into different category or subtopics\nconstruct the drafts from previously organized notes\n\nHere is how I interlink different notes in Obsidian. \n\n\nZettelkasten Apps\nThere are a lot of tools that can implement Zettelkasten notes. I personally use Obsidian for note taking, cause I prefer saving notes locally.\n\nArchive\nRoam Research\nObsidian\n\nObsidian also offers a lot of other features like:\n\nVIM mode support\nDaily Journal\nTemplates\nCustomizable Shortcuts\nCustomizable UI,\n….\n\nI want to write a book. I already started taking notes with Zettelkasten method. I will write a post every day."
