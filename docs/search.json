    "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs), like the human brain, are compression systems. Both compress vast amounts of information into dense neural patterns. Accessing this intelligence - whether artificial or biological - requires the right decompression technique. For humans, it’s asking good questions. For LLMs, it’s writing good prompts.\nTechnology has a pattern of making scarce resources abundant:\nLike these technologies, LLMs are making AI capabilities accessible to everyone. Learning to write effective prompts is becoming as important as learning to code. This post covers the key techniques for getting the most out of LLMs."

    "text": "“Making a full sentence is pretty difficult for the brain.” - Something I learned from one of the great Andrew Huberman podcasts.\n\nI am no trained psychiatrist, but I have an intuition that writing probably makes thinking process easier by taking certain amount of load off from the prefrontal cortex.\n\nWriting & Being Perfect\nI was never good at writing or taking notes. It always took me an awful lot of time get started with any form of writing. Probably I was or still am a perfectionist, and I always wanted to get things right the first time. &gt; Perfectionism stems from the fear of our mortality. - Susan &gt; Cain, Lex Fridman Podcast\nOur brain works by punishing the loss and rewarding the gains. Making mistakes could be detrimental to our survival in the early stages of human existence, and we always receive negative feedbacks from supervisors or peers for our mistakes. Thus we avoid errors, mistakes, or failures at any cost.\nFear of failure could be the major hindrance to our productivity, but in reality failure, or errors are the norm. Getting things right is just rare. If I learned anything in my life, it would be thinking in terms of errors. Our brain hardly predicts anything correctly, nor our actions match the expectations. So let’s modify the optimization target. “We are bound to miss, but we can try to minimize the negative margins.(or increase the positive margins)”\n\n\nHow to Take Smart Notes\nI think learned a few things after reading the book. How to Take Smart Notes (affiliated).\nIt officially introduced me to the concept of Zettlekasten (slipbox, backlinks).\nMain philosophy:\n\nRather taking a top to down approach to writing (think everything through at the start), start from taking random notes, then when think you are ready you can connect the dots and complete the writing (bottom to top).\n\nActionable Steps:\n\ndo your research\ntake notes into slipbox whenever you find something interesting\nreorganize your notes from slipbox with backlinks into different category or subtopics\nconstruct the drafts from previously organized notes\n\nHere is how I interlink different notes in Obsidian. \n\n\nZettelkasten Apps\nThere are a lot of tools that can implement Zettelkasten notes. I personally use Obsidian for note taking, cause I prefer saving notes locally.\n\nArchive\nRoam Research\nObsidian\n\nObsidian also offers a lot of other features like:\n\nVIM mode support\nDaily Journal\nTemplates\nCustomizable Shortcuts\nCustomizable UI,\n….\n\nI want to write a book. I already started taking notes with Zettelkasten method. I will write a post every day."

    "section": "",
    "text": "As we progress through 2025, the tech world is buzzing with excitement about Large Language Models (LLMs) and their potential to revolutionize how we interact with technology. Many are heralding this as “the year of Agents” – autonomous LLM-powered assistants that can perform complex tasks with minimal human intervention.\nSome futurists even predict the eventual disappearance of traditional user interfaces as we speak directly to our AI assistants. But is the web UI truly destined for obsolescence? I believe the reality is more nuanced and exciting.\n\n\n\nLLMs have undoubtedly solved many interface problems. They provide a natural language layer that makes technology more accessible and intuitive. The ability to simply ask for what you want rather than navigating complex menus represents a significant leap forward in human-computer interaction.\nHowever, I firmly believe that web UIs aren’t disappearing – they’re evolving. Visual interfaces remain an integral part of how we understand and process information. Our brains are wired to process visual data efficiently, and the structured presentation of information through thoughtful user interfaces will continue to be valuable.\nThe web UI isn’t just a means to an end; it’s a key piece of our information processing ecosystem. What’s changing is how we interact with these interfaces and how they adapt to our needs.\n\n\n\nRather than replacing UIs, I see a future where LLMs enhance our browsing experience by making web interactions more intuitive, personalized, and efficient. This is why I’ve been working on Overlay – a browser extension designed to bring LLM capabilities directly into your everyday browsing.\nOverlay isn’t about replacing web pages; it’s about augmenting them with contextual intelligence. It’s the difference between eliminating the interface and making it smarter.\n\n\n\nWith projects like Overlay, we’re beginning to see what this enhanced browsing experience might look like:\n\nContextual Understanding: The browser understands the content you’re viewing and can provide relevant insights without you having to switch contexts or applications.\nInformation Synthesis: Rather than manually sifting through multiple tabs and sources, LLMs can analyze content across pages and present consolidated insights.\nTask Automation: Identifying actionable items on web pages and helping you plan or execute them efficiently.\nPersonalized Information Filtering: Learning your preferences to highlight what matters most to you on busy pages.\nSeamless Transitions: Moving between voice commands, text inputs, and traditional clicking/scrolling as appropriate for the task at hand.\n\nThe key insight is that these enhancements work with the existing UI paradigm rather than replacing it. The web page remains the canvas, but the way we interact with it becomes richer and more intuitive.\n\n\n\nThis evolution respects several important realities:\n\nCognitive Load Management: Visual UIs excel at organizing complex information in ways that reduce cognitive load. Even the most advanced LLM can’t replace a well-designed dashboard for certain tasks.\nAgency and Control: Users still want to feel in control of their browsing experience. Augmentation preserves user agency while adding AI assistance.\nAccessibility: Not everyone can or wants to interact primarily through text or voice. Multiple interaction modalities ensure technology remains accessible to all.\nInformation Density: Well-designed UIs can present information at a density and with a spatial organization that sequential text simply cannot match.\n\n\n\n\nAs we move through 2025, I expect we’ll see rapid innovation in this space. The most successful products won’t be those that try to replace UIs entirely but those that thoughtfully blend the strengths of traditional interfaces with the contextual intelligence of LLMs.\nThe future isn’t UI-less – it’s UI-plus. It’s about creating browsing experiences that feel more intuitive, more helpful, and more aligned with human cognition. And that’s exactly what we’re building with Overlay: an enhanced browsing experience that respects the importance of UIs while leveraging the power of LLMs to make them more intuitive and efficient.\nThe web UI isn’t going away.

In plain english too, AMD tells you what is good and what is bad about the car. If I learned anything all those review videos from his channel and others, Toyotas are pretty reliable, they can run for hundreds thousands of miles, and they are easy to maintain, but they are boring and simple cars.\nThe simplicity of the machine makes it easy to maintain, and easy to fix and kinda unbreakable.\n\nMy mate has one. 560 000km 4.2 diesel.

Cause we get derailed by all sort of emotions and thoughts from time to time. We might have different ambitions and plans, we might never reach our destination as we are not a in-control pilots.\nIn terms of people who can control their thoughts and emotions, I could think of David Goggins, and monks from the east.\nThey can override their pain and thoughts. It is higher awareness than can govern bodily impulses and thoughts and fears.\nMeditation is like mental model where you can grab hold of your attention and thoughts, or it is more about learn how to focus and control things. It takes lot’s of practice and dedication. Nothing is free.\nPeople might have different names for this capacity, but I think it is metaconsciousness at work.\nImagine standing in the lounge of a hotel, and you can see doors on the both sides.

You have to login with your account in the plugin settings page. With this you can add subtitles to your videos without too much effort.\n\n\n\nSyncing Remote Folders\nrclone is kinda aggressive, so you have to use --max-delete 0 to keep your files intact in your destination.\nrclone sync --max-delete 0 -v REMOTE_DRIVE:legal_movies movies --stats 10s\n\n\nInternet Access\nThe desktop is connected to a VPS instance with WireGuard. WireGuard is pretty easy to setup.\nHere is the Traefik configuration on the VPS instance.\nA somewhat secure Traefik frontend with automated TLS certificates.\n# docker-compose.yaml\nversion: '3.8'\n\nservices:\n  traefik:\n    image: traefik:v2.3\n    restart: always\n    ports:\n      - \"80:80\"\n      - \"443:443\"\n    volumes:\n      - \"/var/log/traefik:/var/log/traefik\"\n            # save certs so that you won't DDOS letencrypt servers after restart\n      - \"$PWD/certs:/letsencrypt\"\n      - \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro\"\n      - \"$PWD/services/traefik/:/etc/traefik/\"\n\n    labels:\n      - \"traefik.enable=true\"\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.dashboard.rule=Host(`DOMAIN_FOR_DASHBOARD`)\"\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.dashboard.entrypoints=websecure\"\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.dashboard.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt\"\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.dashboard.service=api@internal\"\n\n      ### basic auth\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.dashboard.middlewares=auth\"\n            # admin admin; echo $(htpasswd -nb admin admin) | sed -e s/\\\\$/\\\\$\\\\$/g\n      - \"traefik.http.middlewares.auth.basicauth.users=admin:$$apr1$$k.B4XC1H$$s0IZDaqRa4BX0MwcMHXnD/\" \n\n      ### compression\n      - \"traefik.http.middlewares.test-compress.compress=true\"\n      - \"traefik.http.middlewares.test-compress.compress.excludedcontenttypes=text/event-stream\"\n\n      ### Security related\n      - \"traefik.http.middlewares.test-security.headers.SSLRedirect=true\"\n      #### Note that this uses SSLHost verbatim, so add the port to SSLHost if you are using an alternate port.\n      - \"traefik.http.middlewares.test-security.headers.SSLForceHost=true\"\n      #### The stsSeconds is the max-age of the Strict-Transport-Security header.

    "text": "I am not encouraging any sort of reckless behavior. This is just a random thoughts on the subject of death and immortality.\n\nI have always had a fond inclination towards meditation. I have been practicing meditation on and off for a couple years. I even came up with my own methods of meditation, maybe that is for another post.\nIf I remember correctly I think Andrew Huberman once said that meditation is a special state in which you can upgrade your source code of your brain/consciousness.\nThere are many things we don’t know enough about, and mind/brain is one of them.\nI tried Bhagavad Gita a couple of times but got intimidated by the names and characters as they are all Hindi. It is hard to memorize long names as you have no idea how the Hindi names are constructed. Somehow I pulled through, and finished the book gladly.\nThere are a lot can be learned from the Gita. What struck me the most is the immortality of self .\nDiscourse 2, Bhagavad Gita\n\nThe self is not born nor does it ever die. Once it has been, this self will never cease to be again. Unborn, eternal, continuing from the old, the self is not killed when the body is killed\n\nDiscourse 2, Bhagavad Gita\n\nAnd as you discern your own dharma, you should not waver. For the warrio, htere can be found nothing greater than battle for the sake of dharma.\n\nThe idea is that you are immortal, thus have no fear, face your enemies, pursue your dharma.\n\nYour authority is in action alone, and never in its fruits; motive should never be in the fruits of action, nor should you cling to inaction\n\nFocus on action, not the results, live a meditative life.\nBhagavad Gita means the song of the God. It is as poetic and as beautiful as it can be. It is a book that you can read over and over again, and you will always find something new.\nAfter finishing the Gita, I started reading Meditations by Marcus Aurelius.\nMeditations is a stark contrast to Bhagavad Gita, as Marcus Aurelius is brought upon the knowledge of Greek golden age, in which logic and reason are the main pillars of the society. It also has totally different take on death, that we all die, and we might die at any given moment.\nBook 2\n\nYou may leave this life at any moment: have this possibility in your mind in all that you do or say or think.\n\nBook 3\n\nSo we must have sense of urgency, not only for the ever closer approach of death, but also because our comprehension of the world and our ability to pay proper attention will fade before we do.\n\nDeath is maybe imminent and we should take every action as the last one we can take. This brings the same liberation that Bhagavad Gita brings, although they are achieved by different angles.\nBook 4\n\nNo action should be undertaken without aim, or other than in conformity with principle affirming the art of life.\n\nBook 7\n\nRemember these two things: the action is important, the context indifferent.\n\nOne from the east and one from the west, one is spiritual, and the other is logical, and core ideas somehow converge one way or another. Both are astoundingly beautiful and full of wisdom.\nPrimary function of human existince is self perservation. Bhagavad Gita and Stoic approaches tap into our default mode. We are temporarily phased in a safe space either by realization of our immortality or by the reconcialation with our death. It is as if we shut off the self perservation function, and use that extra power to focus on the task at hand. Or it magnifies the impending danger, such that we have to pull all the energy out to counter the risk. Either way, it is a powerful tool to have in your arsenal."

    "text": "Do you believe in free will? You may or may not believe in free will, but you can’t deny the importance of context. Your context is the environment in which you live in and the content you consumed in the past. Your next move is probably already decided or heavily influenced by your context.\nGarbage in garbage out\nThis I read this phrase from Steal Like an Artist (affiliated) which is the first English book I read, it stuck in my head till this day.\nI have been listening to podcasts for a few years now. Apart from books, podcasts became the main source of information for me.\n\nHuberman Podcast\nThis is probably the best podcast on health and wellness. Professor Andrew Huberman covers a lot of relevant and useful topics. Our body is the only machine that does not come with a user manual. The content Hubermanlab provides can be used as that missing manual. \n\n\nThe Joe Rogan Experience\nHe had some controversial stuff in the past as like the most public figures, so take everything he says with a grain of salt. After hearing lots of MMA and fighting related content, I decided to try out Muay Thai, and it has been the best thing I tried for a long long while. I think Muay Thai had tremendous affect on my physical and mental health.\nCombat sports not only can straighten your belly but also your ego and confidence.\nAnother great thing about his podcast is that he introduces a lot of people from different backgrounds, I got to know David Goggins, Wim Hof, Graham Hancock, Guy Ritchie and many more.\nIt has been more than two years since I started taking cold showers. It kinda gives me the shock and energy to go on when I am low.\nDavid Goggins has a great book. Can’t Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds (affiliated) . The book is about a lazy ass man’s redemption through physical training. It is also a journey of learning how to control your mind. It is really fascinating.\n\n\nLex Fridman Podcast\nHe has really awesome guests. Most of his content is intellectually heavy."
