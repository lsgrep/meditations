They key to speed reading is disabling subvocalization.

At least, previously I thought so.

It is true that subvocalization that slows down reading, but the real increase comes for adeptness at information processing.

Imagine taking a look at the Chessboard, and repeat back the locations of all the pieces.  Reading means live compression, but in order to compress, you need to be able to load/process the information first.

I think I am going to practice memorizing the chessboard, and see if it helps with reading speed.
