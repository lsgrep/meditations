I bought [Rog G16](https://rog.asus.com/laptops/rog-zephyrus/rog-zephyrus-g16-2025-gu605/) a while ago,

It is a decent laptop and fairly expensive as well, but I hated Windows on it.
I need to buy a license in order to customize it (change the UI language). That is stupid.


So I installed Ubuntu, but almost everything worked except the speakers. I tinkered a bit but it is quite hard to fix.
I saw someone mentioned that on Fedora everything works, but changing the OS the a new distro is a huge deal.
I could use a headset but that is a bit annoying.


This week I happen to watch an video of [Linus Torvalds and Linus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfv0V1SxbNA), in which the King mentioned that he uses Fedora.

That settled it for me. I installed Fedora + Plasma and Speakers did work, but the Nvidia driver did not.
Then I tried Fedora with Gnome, and everything worked, and it looks amazing and polished.

And after using Claude Code on my laptop, I realized that this is something else right now.

Claude can help me customize my .zshrc, my Ghostty configs, optimize my system for better performance, can analyze `dmesg` and find out issues.

I encountered an error with regard to Intellij, then Claude fixed it one shot.

Yeah, there are security, privacy issues. But it feels something else.
