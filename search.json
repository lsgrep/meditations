    "text": "Show limited respect\nLately I’ve listened to the audiobook “Elon Musk” by Walter Isaacson.\nHere are a few things I’ve learned from the book.\n\nquestion everything, every requirement, especially the smart people, because they are not challenged enough.\ndelete unnecessary steps, if you are not adding back 10% after deletion, you are not deleting enough.\nsimplify the process\noptimize cycle performance\nautomate everything\nrisk appetite, he has a high risk appetite, he is willing to take risks, and he is willing to fail.\nonly thing you should respect is the laws of physics, everything else is just a recommendation.\n\nHe has a unique way dealing with the external environment, and he has clear set of visions and goals from the get go, which is something I might have lost along the way.\nCould you ask yourself when was the last time you were passionate about something and you made conscious effort to pursue it?\n\nI don’t wanna be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me. - Frank Costello, The Departed\n\nBy in large we live in hierarchical structures, and structure has its own rules and its inertia.\nAt every social structural level, you are requested & demanded to act certain way. These are the “rules”.\nOnly few few few of the people can remind you that you should follow your own dreams and your own rules.\nHonestly, I’ve forgotten the last big thing I’ve wanted to achieve. I was forged to become someone else.\nThe joy and the passion of the pursuit of your dream is the most important thing in your life.\nNo amount of forced “deep work” or heavily structured “productivity” hacks can replace the joy of the pursuit of your dream or alas lasts that long.\nDon’t lose dreams, not to the environment you are in, not to the people you are with, not to the rules you are following."

    "text": "Do you believe in free will? You may or may not believe in free will, but you can’t deny the importance of context. Your context is the environment in which you live in and the content you consumed in the past. Your next move is probably already decided or heavily influenced by your context.\nGarbage in garbage out\nThis I read this phrase from Steal Like an Artist (affiliated) which is the first English book I read, it stuck in my head till this day.\nI have been listening to podcasts for a few years now. Apart from books, podcasts became the main source of information for me.\n\nHuberman Podcast\nThis is probably the best podcast on health and wellness. Professor Andrew Huberman covers a lot of relevant and useful topics. Our body is the only machine that does not come with a user manual. The content Hubermanlab provides can be used as that missing manual. \n\n\nThe Joe Rogan Experience\nHe had some controversial stuff in the past as like the most public figures, so take everything he says with a grain of salt. After hearing lots of MMA and fighting related content, I decided to try out Muay Thai, and it has been the best thing I tried for a long long while. I think Muay Thai had tremendous affect on my physical and mental health.\nCombat sports not only can straighten your belly but also your ego and confidence.\nAnother great thing about his podcast is that he introduces a lot of people from different backgrounds, I got to know David Goggins, Wim Hof, Graham Hancock, Guy Ritchie and many more.\nIt has been more than two years since I started taking cold showers. It kinda gives me the shock and energy to go on when I am low.\nDavid Goggins has a great book. Can’t Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds (affiliated) . The book is about a lazy ass man’s redemption through physical training. It is also a journey of learning how to control your mind. It is really fascinating.\n\n\nLex Fridman Podcast\nHe has really awesome guests. Most of his content is intellectually heavy."

    "text": "I am not encouraging any sort of reckless behavior. This is just a random thoughts on the subject of death and immortality.\n\nI have always had a fond inclination towards meditation. I have been practicing meditation on and off for a couple years. I even came up with my own methods of meditation, maybe that is for another post.\nIf I remember correctly I think Andrew Huberman once said that meditation is a special state in which you can upgrade your source code of your brain/consciousness.\nThere are many things we don’t know enough about, and mind/brain is one of them.\nI tried Bhagavad Gita a couple of times but got intimidated by the names and characters as they are all Hindi. It is hard to memorize long names as you have no idea how the Hindi names are constructed. Somehow I pulled through, and finished the book gladly.\nThere are a lot can be learned from the Gita. What struck me the most is the immortality of self .\nDiscourse 2, Bhagavad Gita\n\nThe self is not born nor does it ever die. Once it has been, this self will never cease to be again. Unborn, eternal, continuing from the old, the self is not killed when the body is killed\n\nDiscourse 2, Bhagavad Gita\n\nAnd as you discern your own dharma, you should not waver. For the warrio, htere can be found nothing greater than battle for the sake of dharma.\n\nThe idea is that you are immortal, thus have no fear, face your enemies, pursue your dharma.\n\nYour authority is in action alone, and never in its fruits; motive should never be in the fruits of action, nor should you cling to inaction\n\nFocus on action, not the results, live a meditative life.\nBhagavad Gita means the song of the God. It is as poetic and as beautiful as it can be. It is a book that you can read over and over again, and you will always find something new.\nAfter finishing the Gita, I started reading Meditations by Marcus Aurelius.\nMeditations is a stark contrast to Bhagavad Gita, as Marcus Aurelius is brought upon the knowledge of Greek golden age, in which logic and reason are the main pillars of the society. It also has totally different take on death, that we all die, and we might die at any given moment.\nBook 2\n\nYou may leave this life at any moment: have this possibility in your mind in all that you do or say or think.\n\nBook 3\n\nSo we must have sense of urgency, not only for the ever closer approach of death, but also because our comprehension of the world and our ability to pay proper attention will fade before we do.\n\nDeath is maybe imminent and we should take every action as the last one we can take. This brings the same liberation that Bhagavad Gita brings, although they are achieved by different angles.\nBook 4\n\nNo action should be undertaken without aim, or other than in conformity with principle affirming the art of life.\n\nBook 7\n\nRemember these two things: the action is important, the context indifferent.\n\nOne from the east and one from the west, one is spiritual, and the other is logical, and core ideas somehow converge one way or another. Both are astoundingly beautiful and full of wisdom.\nPrimary function of human existince is self perservation. Bhagavad Gita and Stoic approaches tap into our default mode. We are temporarily phased in a safe space either by realization of our immortality or by the reconcialation with our death. It is as if we shut off the self perservation function, and use that extra power to focus on the task at hand. Or it magnifies the impending danger, such that we have to pull all the energy out to counter the risk. Either way, it is a powerful tool to have in your arsenal."

    "text": "Metaconscious\nTill now, we still don’t know how the brain works. Although, in the east, west there are different schools of thoughts on how to meditate and how to control the brain how to live a life.\nI think we are getting far less and less spiritual and the same with our capacity to getting into the flow of meditation state.\nWe do rely on medications and pills to regulate our moods.\nTo me, having full control thoughts, emotions, feelings is like a superpower. Cause we get derailed by all sort of emotions and thoughts from time to time. We might have different ambitions and plans, we might never reach our destination as we are not a in-control pilots.\nIn terms of people who can control their thoughts and emotions, I could think of David Goggins, and monks from the east.\nThey can override their pain and thoughts. It is higher awareness than can govern bodily impulses and thoughts and fears.\nMeditation is like mental model where you can grab hold of your attention and thoughts, or it is more about learn how to focus and control things. It takes lot’s of practice and dedication. Nothing is free.\nPeople might have different names for this capacity, but I think it is metaconsciousness at work.\nImagine standing in the lounge of a hotel, and you can see doors on the both sides. Each door represents some sort of impulse or need of yours.\nYou can choose to open the door and let the impulse in, or you can choose to ignore it.\nWhen troubled, always remember you are the one who can choose to open the door or not, and there are many doors to choose from."

Reading means live compression, but in order to compress, you need to be able to load/process the information first.\nI think I am going to practice memorizing the chessboard, and see if it helps with reading speed."

It always took me an awful lot of time get started with any form of writing. Probably I was or still am a perfectionist, and I always wanted to get things right the first time. &gt; Perfectionism stems from the fear of our mortality. - Susan &gt; Cain, Lex Fridman Podcast\nOur brain works by punishing the loss and rewarding the gains. Making mistakes could be detrimental to our survival in the early stages of human existence, and we always receive negative feedbacks from supervisors or peers for our mistakes. Thus we avoid errors, mistakes, or failures at any cost.\nFear of failure could be the major hindrance to our productivity, but in reality failure, or errors are the norm. Getting things right is just rare. If I learned anything in my life, it would be thinking in terms of errors. Our brain hardly predicts anything correctly, nor our actions match the expectations. So let’s modify the optimization target. “We are bound to miss, but we can try to minimize the negative margins.(or increase the positive margins)”\n\n\nHow to Take Smart Notes\nI think learned a few things after reading the book. How to Take Smart Notes (affiliated).\nIt officially introduced me to the concept of Zettlekasten (slipbox, backlinks).\nMain philosophy:\n\nRather taking a top to down approach to writing (think everything through at the start), start from taking random notes, then when think you are ready you can connect the dots and complete the writing (bottom to top).\n\nActionable Steps:\n\ndo your research\ntake notes into slipbox whenever you find something interesting\nreorganize your notes from slipbox with backlinks into different category or subtopics\nconstruct the drafts from previously organized notes\n\nHere is how I interlink different notes in Obsidian. \n\n\nZettelkasten Apps\nThere are a lot of tools that can implement Zettelkasten notes. I personally use Obsidian for note taking, cause I prefer saving notes locally.\n\nArchive\nRoam Research\nObsidian\n\nObsidian also offers a lot of other features like:\n\nVIM mode support\nDaily Journal\nTemplates\nCustomizable Shortcuts\nCustomizable UI,\n….\n\nI want to write a book.
